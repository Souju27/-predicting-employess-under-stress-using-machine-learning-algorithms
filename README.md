Predicting Employees under Stress to Balance their Work and Personal Life using Machine Learning Algorithms

Abstract: Businesses and organizations have adapted to irregular and varied working ways and patterns as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic. Work from home or working with a small number of staff is most common these days in many offices. Employees have been trying to adapt to this changing work and customized environments, which has resulted in psychological stress and lethargy for many employees as they try to manage their personal and professional lifeâ€™s. To anticipate employee stress levels, machine learning algorithms were used in this project. A prototyping model is created based on data to help anticipate whether an employee is stressed or not. The Support Vector Machines and Random Forest classifiers are employed in this project for the prediction process, and the findings reveal that the strategy makes it easier to acquire a more reliable model performance. After using the Support Vector Machines and Random Forest classifiers to evaluate the data, it was discovered that working hours, workload, age, and role ambiguity all have a significant and negative impact on employee performance. As a result, it is concluded that increasing working hours, role ambiguity, and workload would reduce employee representation from all angles.
